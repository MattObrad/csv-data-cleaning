Extremely well-maintained. Bought as a certified used Mercedes. Adult owned never dragged or raced. I added a fully reversible Eurocharge stage 1 tune that bumps the torque from 479ft/lbs to an amazing 638ft/lbs which truly unleashes the beast in this vehicle. You’re in for a brutal and exhilarating acceleration. If you prefer it without the tune I can reverse it for you at no cost. I just installed brand new OEM Michelin tires in the rear with less than 15 miles on them. Original manual and two keys.Fully loaded. MSRP 144k. Driven less than 100 miles per month.

Reviews:  * Shop here if you need your SUV to carry up to eight passengers all of their stuff and tow up to 8300 pounds. Not only can you do all that but youll look good while doing it. Source: KBB.com  * Available seating for up to eight passengers; strong V8 power; stout towing capacity; quiet interior. Source: Edmunds  * The well-recognized Escalade has been among the Kings of the SUV family for years. For 2015 the much loved SUV has been revamped and upgraded. The classic eye-catching look of the Escalade remains unchanged riding high on it's traditional body-frame. But for some it's on what's on the inside that counts. The all new interior is wrapped in a wealth of perforated leather prominent stitching and genuine wood while tiered surfaces demonstrate a level of detail and craftsmanship unmatched in previous generations. The dash and instrument panel are anchored by the flashy CUE multimedia system and its 8-inch touchscreen interface. CUE uses proximity sensors to activate common options and controls as the user's hand approaches. Opt for the larger 12.3in and embrace the HD graphics. The front and rear ends use steeply stacked vertical layouts for the standard LED headlights and taillights and Cadillac's grille design is presented in its largest form yet. The Escalade also carries over a 6.2-liter V8 this one comes from the latest generation of direct-injection engines with output increased to 420HP and 460 lb-ft of torque. This combination combusts in a freight train-like pull when you hit the throttle. The base rear-wheel-drive Escalade can tow up to 8200 pounds  making it useful for those who aren't afraid to get a little dirty. Escalade's new technologies include safety features to help protect occupants at all times; front and rear automatic braking relies short-range radar technology and ultrasonic sensors to help avoid front and rear low-speed collisions. Driver Awareness packages include Forward Collision Alert Lane Departure Warning System and the patented Safety Alert Seat which uses directional vibrations to alert the driver to potential crash threats.

Onyx Black 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 SLE RWD 6-Speed Automatic Electronic with Overdrive EcoTec3 4.3L V6 Flex Fuel  Awards:   * 2014 KBB.com Brand Image Awards Come see your friends today at Patriot CDJR in McAlester, OK! Visit our online showroom at   today!  Reviews:   * New, more fuel-efficient engines; improved interior; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 Sierras innovative powertrains and handsome aesthetics should appeal to longtime GMC fans and tempt buyers new to the brand. In just one of many mine is bigger battles in the half-ton truck market, the 2014 Sierras 12,000-pound max tow rating is expected to be king  at least for now. Source: KBB.com   * The 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 is all new for 2014. It possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. Open the doors and the Sierra's interior welcomes you into a calming and comfortable retreat from the busy outside world. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs, which are more convenient to grab. Spoil yourself with the available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims. It lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Base Level Sierra trims on all models come with a powerful 4.3-Liter V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285 horsepower and a 6-speed automatic transmission. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes. Plus, since you have the choice between two to three trims based on the model picked, GMC has a 2014 Sierra 1500 for just about anyone.

Body is in exceptional condition with no rust, no major dents, scratches or dings, and the paint has a high gloss shine; interior is impeccably clean with no stains, no odors, no rips or tears, no smoking, and no excess wear; alloy wheels are in like new condition with no pitting or peeling.  I will try to make the explanation of the service history as simple as possible. Since the time this car was new, it has been serviced at the Subaru Dealer, and serviced exactly as recommended by Subaru. Every minor and major service has been done, spot on, with absolutely no services skipped or missed and absolutely no gaps in the service history. You will not find a more thorough service history, and I have the entire 21 page service history from the local Subaru Dealer to go with the car.  It has been serviced a total of 34 times, which means that the car has been serviced an average of every 2,100 miles since new. (Subaru recommends service on this car every 3,750 miles). Vehicle was just serviced at the Subaru Dealer about 600 miles ago and got everything that they recommended, which included a new muffler, wiper blades, full synthetic oil change and VT State Inspection, which is now good though 12/31/21. This Forester also got new front brakes about 3,000 miles ago, and new spark plugs as part of the 60k mile major service, which was completed less than 10k miles ago.  Additionally, the car has 4 like new Nokian Hakkapeliitta R3 winter tires on it now. Starting in 2011, Subaru started using the updated triple layer steel head gaskets that never require replacement, and they switched the engine design from a timing belt to a timing chain, which has no recommended maintenance or replacement. This Forester runs and drives great, no ""problem lights"" on, vehicle has great power, shifts smoothly, sounds and feels tight over bumps, goes down the road straight with no shaking or pulling, brake pedal is high and tight with no shaking or squeaking, interior cabin is very quiet even at highway speeds, ride is very smooth, all options work, everything is very tight, and fuel economy is excellent for an all wheel drive vehicle. Clean title in hand, clean Carfax report, 1 owner, and no accidents.  Vehicle comes with all 3 original keys; two keys with built in buttons for factory alarm/keyless entry/panic/trunk release, plus a valet key, and the owner's manual and all related literature in the original Subaru leather pouch. This Forester is priced $1,000 below NADA retail or ""high book value,"" and it goes well beyond meeting the description of what a vehicle should be, condition wise and mechanically, to deserve high book value; price is currently firm. This car is truly the exception to the rule condition-wise.  If you put this car in a showroom and put the original window sticker back in it, most folks walking by wouldn't even notice that it wasn't new.  Current odometer reading is 70,678.

Bought from “ONE OWNER” 3 months ago. Here’s the back story. I ordered me a brand new Sports car in November but was told It would not built and delivered until about November 2021, which was fine. So I wanted a sports car to drive until my new car gets built this year. Well…..the dealer contacted me in Feb and stated my allocation came in and my new car will now be built in approximately 60-90 days as long as there are no other issues with the parts supplier. Bottom line I must sale now to prepare for my new car. This infiniti is in awesome condition and has been well taken care of and loaded with 6 speed transmission, power everything, including navigation, and sunroof. Only have 113,600 miles (miles will go up), new tires, enterior mint condition, window sticker, all Owners manuals and books still in plastic. Some clear coat peeling off mirrors, antenna, and door handles (can be repainted for about $350) and small scuff on left side rear that need touched up. It is well worth the asking price of $11,999. I am not looking to trade but if you have something that’s equal to my asking price of my Infiniti and its a non-sports coupe I might entertain but prefer to Sale outright.  Possible muscle car, 4 dr sports sedan, etc... The car is now located at the for sale lot on Fort Gordon, Georgia. Call with questions!",,ga,33.413,-82.1337,2021-04-14T07:00:52-0400

Conversely, Ford and Chevy owners who long for a more upscale interior will find a lot to like in the Ram HD. Source: KBB.com* High-quality cabin; massive torque with diesel/automatic powertrain; roomy rear seat in the Mega Cab; highly off-road-capable Power Wagon version; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds* If you want a heavy-duty truck engineered to give you the power you need and deliver it in a gorgeous package, look no further than the Ram 2500. With its signature rounded curves and huge front grille, this truck is instantly recognizable and respected wherever it goes. The Ram 2500 is sold in 3 sizes: Regular Cab, Mega Cab and Crew Cab, and has a wide range of trims to choose from. The Regular Cab offers 3 options: the base level Tradesman, the Big Horn and the SLT. The Mega Cab has 4 trims, with the SLT being the lowest. Finally the Crew Cab offers a stunning seven trims to pick from with the Tradesman being the lowest. All Ram 2500 trucks come standard with an impressive 5.7-liter HEMI V8 Engine with 410 HP and 429 lb-ft of Torque, and an Automatic 6-speed transmission. It is also available in two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive versions on most models except the following Crew Cab Trims: Tradesman Power Wagon, Outdoorsman, Power Wagon, and Laramie Power Wagon where 4WD is the only option. The interior of the 2500 is a beautiful combination of strength and refinement. The environment has a polished feel even on the base trims. The regular cab can seat 3 on a bench, and the 4-door versions can either seat 5 when there are two-bucket seats up front, or 6 people on 2 rows. The base model offers an AM FM stereo with MP3 for your music, as well as an Auxiliary Input and USB Port. The Mega and Crew cabs add a Uconnect communication system, media hub, and all models include the Vehicle Information Center.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

I purchased the vehicle last a little over a year ago. Since I purchased it I have been doing upgrades and large amounts of mechanical work to make it a reliable overland vehicle. Things have changed a bit and made it difficult to finish the small amount of work needed. I have all records from previous owner as well as all records since I have owned it. I have a friend that works at a Toyota dealership. I have had 95% of all work performed at the dealership where he works. Previous owner had front seats redone, rear seats are in very good shape especially for the age. No major leaks. Lots of upgrades and spares.

We also hand pick our trucks and suvs from a rust free environment. So 1-2 years down the road you're not wishing you'd never seen that rusty truck. Something we strive to avoid. We pay more for the non-rusty vehicles so your not stuck with costly rust repairs. Not only the repairs you can see but the ones you can't. which include things like brakes, exhaust, frame rot, bed support rot and the one thing that cost you more in the long run, the things that nobody really hears about.... its when you take your truck in for a repair of any kind and the mechanic has to spend hours fighting the rusty bolts and brackets that have fused themselves together. This will definitely cost you money. Why you ask?? Because time and more importantly mechanic frustration cost you money!!

Got it in a trade with the intention of fixing it up as a daily but haven't had time. I have a replacement door for the passenger side that will come with the car. I put a new alternator and oil pump on it but it's still showing low oil pressure once it warms up.  The engine does knock briefly on start-up as well. The cylinder bores, rods, and pistons looked okay from the underside when I was replacing the oil pump & didn't seem to have play but I haven't had time to diagnose further.   It will run & drive under its own power but should probably be trailered if you're going far.  900 bucks OBO, just need it gone. May trade for freedom seeds or other items in that category.
